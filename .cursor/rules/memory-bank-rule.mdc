The memory-bank folder is your persistent source of project context, documentation and guidelines. Follow these steps when executing any tasks:


1. Pre-Task Check:
   - Prior to writing or modifying any code, read all the memory-bank files to align with the project’s overall context.
   - Use projectbrief.md and productContext.md to understand the project's purpose.
   - Refer to systemPatterns.md and techContext.md to ensure adherence to technical and architectural guidelines.
   - Check activeContext.md for the current state of development.

2. During Development:
   - Follow the documented guidelines without overriding decisions in projectbrief.md, systemPatterns.md, or techContext.md unless these files have been explicitly updated.
   - As new insights or changes arise, immediately document them in activeContext.md.
   - Record progress, milestones, and significant updates in progress.md.

3. Post-Task Update:
   - After completing a task or making major changes, re-read the memory bank to ensure consistency.
   - Update the relevant markdown files to reflect the new state of the project and any changes made.
   - Validate that all modifications align with the overall project context.

4. Error Correction & Consistency:
   - If you encounter inconsistencies or outdated information, update the appropriate memory-bank file promptly and note the correction.
   - Continuously maintain an accurate and evolving representation of the project’s context by revisiting the memory bank regularly.

5. Ongoing Reference:
   - Throughout multi-file edits or new code additions, periodically refer back to the memory-bank files to ensure your work is in sync with established guidelines.
   - If any conflicts or uncertainties arise between new changes and existing documentation, pause and consult the memory bank for clarification before proceeding.

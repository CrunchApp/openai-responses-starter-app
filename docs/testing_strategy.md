### 2. Integration Testing
- **Coverage Target**: Key user flows and API interactions
- **Responsibility**: Developers with QA support
- **Timeline**: After unit tests, before feature deployment

#### Frontend Integration Testing
- **Framework**: Cypress
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Multi-step form submissions
  - Authentication flows
  - User profile management
  - Recommendation request/display
  - Chatbot interactions

#### Backend Integration Testing
- **Framework**: pytest with TestClient
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Complete API endpoints
  - Database interactions
  - External service integrations (mocked)
  - Authentication flows

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **Coverage Target**: Critical user journeys
- **Responsibility**: QA team with developer support
- **Timeline**: Before sprint completion/feature release

- **Framework**: Cypress
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Complete user journeys (registration to recommendations)
  - Social login flows
  - Document upload/download
  - Chatbot multi-turn conversations

### 4. Security Testing
- **Coverage Target**: All authentication and data storage functions
- **Responsibility**: Security-focused developers and external review
- **Timeline**: Before public release and after significant changes

- **Types**:
  - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning
  - Authentication penetration testing
  - API security validation
  - Data encryption verification
  - File upload security checks

### 5. Performance Testing
- **Coverage Target**: Key user interactions and API endpoints
- **Responsibility**: DevOps and developers
- **Timeline**: Before production deployment

- **Framework**: k6 / Artillery
- **Focus Areas**:
  - API response times under load
  - Recommendation engine performance
  - Chat API latency
  - File upload/download speed
  - Database query performance

## Test Environments

### Local Development Environment
- Purpose: Developer testing during feature implementation
- Setup: Local machine with Docker containers for dependencies
- Data: Sample test data

### CI/CD Test Environment
- Purpose: Automated testing during build process
- Setup: GitHub Actions workflows
- Data: Test fixtures and mocked external services

### Staging Environment
- Purpose: Pre-production validation
- Setup: Identical to production but with isolated databases
- Data: Anonymized production-like data

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures
- Standard user profiles for different persona types
- Sample educational programs for recommendations
- Mock conversation histories for chatbot testing

### Data Isolation
- Test database separation from production
- Reset mechanisms between test runs
- Mock external APIs to avoid real service calls

## Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration
- Run unit and integration tests on every pull request
- Run end-to-end tests on main branch commits
- Security scans on scheduled basis
- Performance tests before production deployment

### Test Reports
- Test results dashboard in CI/CD pipeline
- Code coverage reports
- Performance test trend analysis
- Security scanning reports

## Manual Testing

### Exploratory Testing
- Conducted by QA and developers
- Focus on user experience and edge cases
- Documented using structured templates

### User Acceptance Testing
- Conducted with stakeholder representatives
- Focused on real-world scenarios
- Feedback collection and prioritization

## Special Testing Considerations

### Accessibility Testing
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast validation

### Cross-browser/Device Testing
- Browser matrix: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Device testing: Desktop, tablet, mobile
- OS testing: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android

### Third-party Integration Testing
- OpenAI API integration
- Social login providers (Google, LinkedIn)
- Google Custom Search API
- Cloud storage (S3/Firebase)

## Testing Tools & Resources

### Frontend Testing
- Jest: Unit testing
- React Testing Library: Component testing
- Cypress: End-to-end testing
- Lighthouse: Performance and accessibility

### Backend Testing
- pytest: Python testing framework
- Coverage.py: Code coverage
- Postman/Newman: API testing
- Swagger/OpenAPI: API documentation and testing

### Security Testing
- OWASP ZAP: Security scanning
- Bandit: Python code security scanning
- ESLint security plugins: JavaScript security scanning

### Performance Testing
- k6: Load and performance testing
- Artillery: API load testing
- New Relic/Datadog: Performance monitoring (future)

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

### TDD for Critical Components
- Write tests before implementation for:
  - Authentication flows
  - Recommendation engine
  - Data processing functions
  - Security-critical components

### TDD Process
1. Write failing test describing expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to pass the test
3. Refactor code while maintaining test success
4. Repeat for additional functionality

## Bug Tracking & Test Management

### Bug Lifecycle
1. Bug identification and documentation
2. Severity/priority assessment
3. Assignment and fixing
4. Verification and closure

### Test Case Management
- Organize test cases by feature and type
- Maintain traceability to requirements
- Track execution history and results
- Document test environment configurations

## Continuous Improvement

### Test Retrospectives
- Regular review of testing effectiveness
- Identify gaps in coverage or approach
- Implement improvements to testing process

### Test Metrics
- Test pass/fail rates
- Code coverage trends
- Bug detection efficiency
- Time spent on testing activities

## Release Criteria

### Quality Gates
- All unit and integration tests passing
- No high or critical security issues
- Performance within acceptable thresholds
- Accessibility requirements met
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

### Test Sign-off Process
1. QA verification of all test results
2. Developer confirmation of technical quality
3. Product owner review of user acceptance results
4. Final approval for deployment

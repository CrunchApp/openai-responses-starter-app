# Vista Education Adviser - System Patterns

## Architectural Overview
Vista is organized as a full-stack application with distinct frontend and backend components:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Currently planned as FastAPI (Python), deployed on Heroku

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Modular Component Architecture (Frontend)
- Use reusable UI components organized by feature domains
- Maintain clear separation between presentation and business logic
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)

### 2. API-First Design (Backend)
- Develop RESTful APIs with clear contracts defined by schemas
- Implement proper status codes and error handling
- Use versioning for future API evolution

### 3. Service-Oriented Architecture
- Organize backend services by domain functionality:
  - Authentication Service
  - Profile Management Service
  - Recommendation Engine Service
  - Chatbot Service
  - File Upload Service
- Each service maintains its own data models and business logic

### 4. Repository Pattern (Data Access)
- Encapsulate data access logic in dedicated repositories
- Provide a consistent API for data operations
- Allow for swapping out data sources with minimal impact

### 5. Rule-Based Engine (Initially)
- Implement recommendations using a rule-based matching system
- Structure rules in a way that allows for future AI enhancement
- Log recommendation outcomes for future ML training

### 6. AI Integration Pattern
- Utilize API-based integration with OpenAI
- Maintain conversation context for improved responses
- Implement appropriate content filtering and safety measures

### 7. Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT for authentication between client and server
- Implement proper OAuth flows for social logins
- Maintain clear role-based permissions

## System Relationships
- **User → Profile**: One-to-one relationship
- **Profile → Recommendations**: One-to-many relationship
- **User → Conversations**: One-to-many relationship
- **Conversation → Messages**: One-to-many relationship
- **User → Documents**: One-to-many relationship

## Application State Management
- Use appropriate state management based on complexity
- For simple state: React Context or hooks
- For complex state: Consider Zustand or similar lightweight solution

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Logging**: Consistent approach across all modules
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error processing and user-friendly responses
- **Security**: Input validation, CSRF protection, secure headers
- **Performance**: Optimization through caching strategies and lazy loading

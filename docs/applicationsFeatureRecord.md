Here's a concise record of our recent conversation and the edits we made—use this as a reference when you revisit or extend the feature:

1. Introduced "Applications" feature  
   • Created two new tables in Supabase via a migration:  
     – **applications** (stores user, recommendation, file IDs, checklist/timeline JSON)  
     – **application_tasks** (breaks checklist into individual tasks)  
     – Added RLS policies, update-triggers on `updated_at`, and owner-only access.  

2. AI-driven plan generation  
   • `lib/ai/applicationManager.ts`  
     – `generateApplicationPlan()` leverages the GPT-4.1 agentic prompting guide with explicit role/objective, persistence reminder, tool-calling & planning strategy, reasoning steps, final output-format instructions, and strict JSON Schema enforcement.  
     – Supports chaining conversation context via `store: true` and `previous_response_id` to maintain state across user turns.  
     – Continues to fallback to a stub plan when no API key is set.  

3. Data-layer helpers  
   • `lib/data/applications.ts`  
     – `createApplicationWithPlan()` inserts an application and its tasks in one shot.  
     – `getApplicationState()` fetches both application record and its tasks.  
     – `updateApplicationTask()` patches a single task's status or due date.  

4. Function-calling plumbing  
   • `config/tools-list.ts` & `config/functions.ts`  
     – Added four new assistant tools:  
       1. `get_application_state`  
       2. `update_application_task`  
       3. `save_application_plan`  
       4. `list_user_applications`  
     – Wired each tool to a Next.js API route under `/api/functions/…`.  

5. API routes  
   • **POST** `/api/functions/save_application_plan`  
     – Authenticates via Supabase, fetches profile & program file IDs, then calls `createApplicationWithPlan()` to store the generated plan and returns `application_id`.  
   • **POST** `/api/functions/list_user_applications`  
     – Authenticates via Supabase and returns a list of the user's applications (with `id` and `recommendation_id`).  
   • **POST** `/api/functions/get_application_state`  
     – Returns the timeline & task list for a given application.  
   • **POST** `/api/functions/update_application_task`  
     – Updates a single task's fields.  

6. Front-end integration  
   • **ProgramCard** (app/recommendations/pathway/[id]/_components/ProgramCard.tsx)  
     – Added "Start application process" button  
       • Invokes `create_application_plan`, then navigates to `/applications/[application_id]`.  
       • Shows spinner + error messages on failure.  
   • **Dynamic Applications page** (app/applications/[id]/page.tsx)  
     – Fetches state via `get_application_state`.  
     – Renders timeline events and a checklist of tasks.  
     – Allows toggling each task's status via `update_application_task`.  

7. Fixes & tweaks  
   • Cleaned up TypeScript errors (non-nullable assertions, correct Button variants).  
   • Corrected markup typos (header closing tags).  
   • Addressed OpenAI parameter error by dropping unsupported `file_ids` key.  

8. Recent discussion & proposed improvements  
   • Restored the `/api/functions/create_application_plan` route and corresponding tool in config/functions to enable end-to-end LLM-driven plan generation via file_search + web_search.  
   • Identified that the assistant was returning generic plans because the FileSearch tool wasn't enabled or vector store IDs were misconfigured, so profile/program context was missing.  
   • Implemented direct-fetch of profile & program data in the `create_application_plan` handler and JSON-embedded prompts, along with explicit instruction to use the `web_search` tool for live program details—ensuring reliable context without vector-store/file_search.  
   • Revamped `generateApplicationPlan` to follow the GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide: added agentic prompts, reasoning structure, persistence, tool-calling, and chaining support.  
   • Once stable, consider re-enabling vector-store/file_search for advanced retrieval scenarios.  
   • Added major UI/UX updates: unified "Start/Application" flows in ProgramCard and SavedProgramsView (spinner, duplicate prevention, error states) and created a new `ApplicationsView` component in the Recommendations page to list and inspect started applications seamlessly.  

Next steps and polish ideas:  
• Fetch and embed raw profile & program data into the prompt for guaranteed context and richer plan generation.  
• Finalize UI polish: theming, accessibility, and responsiveness across ProgramCard, SavedProgramsView, and ApplicationsView.  
• Add unit/integration tests around API routes, data helpers, and plan-generation flows (including application generation and state).  
• Consider migrating `generateApplicationPlan` to use Structured Outputs with a JSON schema for stricter guarantees.  
• Use `supabase.auth.getUser()` in API routes for secure authentication checks.  
• After stabilizing the prompt approach, revisit file_search & vector-store for advanced retrieval scenarios.

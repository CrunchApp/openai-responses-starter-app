# Vista Education Adviser - Active Context

## Current Development Status
- **Phase**: Initial project setup
- **Status**: Starting from the openai-responses-starter-app repository
- **Focus**: Setting up the project foundation and memory-bank for unified context

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Explore the current codebase structure from the starter app
2. Determine which components can be reused or adapted
3. Plan and implement the user authentication system
4. Design the user profile data model
5. Implement the recommendation engine with initial rule-based logic
6. Integrate the OpenAI API for the chatbot functionality

## Active Tasks
